Problem Statement
 
We want to build a parking lot management application. Multiple parking lots want to use this application.
Application should cater to multiple parking lots
There are two types of vehicles: Two-Wheeler, Car
Each parking lot has separate capacity for each kind of vehicle. For example: 20 car spots and 50 bike spots at lot A.
There are different rate cards for each kind of vehicle.
For example,
2 wheelers: 0-2h : Rs 20, 2-4h: Rs 50, 4h-1d: Rs 80, >1d - 80 per day
4 wheelers: 0-1h: Rs 30, 1-3h: Rs 70, 3h-1d: Rs 100, >1d - 100 per day

The application should have the following features
Register a parking lot with its capacities and rate card.
Park a Vehicle at a given parking lot (should fail if the lot is full)
Exit from the parking area and tell the amount due for the duration.
Given a vehicle no., see complete parking history (Lot, Duration, Amount Paid)
 

Expectations
You are free to use any programming language. You can write a CLI, a HTTP API, or even just methods that you call and demonstrate in a wrapper program.
You will program on your own machine. Please ensure you have your IDE or development environment set up.
You have access to documentation and all of the internet
Focus on building a working demo first.
Good code structure and modelling is a plus
Database is optional. Wouldnâ€™t recommend setting up a db, it takes a lot of time. In memory stores or flat files are fine.
